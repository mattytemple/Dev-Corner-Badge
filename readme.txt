Places a highly visible marker in the upper corner of every post/page to denote a development site.

== Description ==

Sometimes you're developing a theme or a site, and it looks similar to (or exactly like) the production version of that site. Installing this plugin will make it instantly easy to see that you're looking at your development site.

**NEW!** Adjust the position and behavior of the badge, and add optional link and custom text.

* Positions: Stick the badge on the left or the right corner.
* Behaviors: Absolute (stick to the top of the page) or Fixed (stick to the top of the browser window).
* Optional Link URL: The badge can link back to the production version of a site or anywhere else.
* Optional Custom Text: The default badge reads "Development Version" but you can now use your own custom text (15 character max).

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `dev-corner-badge` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
